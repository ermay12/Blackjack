This is a command line implementation of black jack.  Run by typing the following in the command prompt or terminal:

java -jar Blackjack.jar

To run, the console you are running this in must be at least 80 characters wide and no more than 50 characters high.  It is also super important that the font of the terminal be of uniform dimensions.  Meaning, the width of a whitespace character must equal that of any other character.  The default windows command prompt should be adequate.

Finally, if your terminal or terminal's font does not support all unicode characters, the the suit of each card will not be visible and likely replaced by question marks.

Enjoy the game and here is a link to me demo-ing it.
